# [Storacle](https://github.com/ortexx/storacle/) [alpha] [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/storacle.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/storacle) [![Build status](https://github.com/ortexx/storacle/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ortexx/storacle/actions)

Storacle is a decentralized file storage based on [the spreadable protocol](https://github.com/ortexx/spreadable/).

```javascript
const Node = require('storacle').Node;

(async () => {  
  try {
    const node = new Node({
      port: 4000,
      hostname: 'localhost'
    });
    await node.init();
  }
  catch(err) {
    console.error(err.stack);
    process.exit(1);
  }
})();
```

```javascript
const Client = require('storacle').Client;

(async () => {  
  try {
    const client = new Client({
      address: 'localhost:4000'
    });
    await client.init();

    // Store our file
    const hash = await client.storeFile('./my-file');

    // Get the direct file link
    const link = await client.getFileLink(hash);

    // Create the requested file link
    const requestedLink = client.createRequestedFileLink(hash);
    
    // Remove the file
    await client.removeFile(hash);
  }
  catch(err) {
    console.error(err.stack);
    process.exit(1);
  }
})();
```

The example above shows the simplest use of the library. But the server can be flexibly configured.

## Browser client
You can also use the client in a browser. Look at the description of [the spreadable library](https://github.com/ortexx/spreadable/#how-to-use-the-client-in-a-browser). In window you have __window.ClientStoracle__ instead of __window.ClientSpreadable__. The prepared file name is __storacle.client.js__.

## How to use it via the command line
Look at the description of [the spreadable library](https://github.com/ortexx/spreadable/#how-to-use-it-via-the-command-line). You only need to change everywhere **spreadable** word to **storacle**.

## How it works

Nodes interact via [the spreadable mechanism](https://github.com/ortexx/spreadable/). The file can be added to the network through any node. Files are saved entirely, not splitted into parts. After saving you get a hash of the file. With this hash you can later get it again, delete it or do something else. If possible, links to files are cached so if you work with the same file and in some other cases you will receive it immediately without re-traversing the network. For better reliability files can be duplicated. How exactly you can customize yourself. By default, each file tends to have its copies in amount of __Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(networkSize))__.

## What are the limitations
The number of files on one node is limited by the file system. The speed of receiving / saving in the network files is limited by spreadable protocol.

## What are the requirements
Look at [the spreadable requirements](https://github.com/ortexx/spreadable/#what-are-the-requirements).

## Where to use it

### 1. Wherever files need to be stored decentralized
For example, you can create a network that stores books, invite new members, gather a large collection of books, and share links with others. Instead of books there could be anything else.

### 2. For own needs
Storing files of your own projects, websites, etc. The network can be made private and you will not need to figure out how to organize the file storage.

### 3. Serverless solutions
Since the library is written in javascript, you can receive / send / work with files in the browser and do not use server code at all. In some cases, it can be very convenient.

## Node configuration

When you create an instance of the node you can pass options below. Only specific options of this library are described here, without considering the options of the parent classes.

* {integer} __[request.clientStoringConcurrency=20]__ - the maximum number of simultaneous client storing requests per endpoint.

* {number|string} __[request.fileStoringNodeTimeout="2h"]__ - file storing timeout.

* {number|string} __[request.cacheTimeout=250]__ - file cache link check timeout.

* {number|string} __[storage.dataSize="45%"]__ - amount of space for storing files. If indicated in percent, the calculation will be based on the maximum available disk space.

* {number|string} __[storage.tempSize="45%"]__ - amount of space for temporary files. If indicated in percent, the calculation will be based on  the maximum available disk space.

* {number|string} __[storage.tempLifetime="2h"]__ - temporary files holding period.

* {integer} __[storage.autoCleanSize=0]__ - amount of space that should always be free. If indicated in percent, the calculation will be based on storage.dataSize. 

* {object} __[file]__ - section that responds for a single file settings.

* {number|string} __[file.maxSize="40%"]__ - maximum size of one file. If indicated in percent, the calculation will be based on the maximum available disk space. 

* {number|string} __[file.minSize=0]__ - minimum size of one file. If indicated in percent, the calculation will be based on the maximum available disk space. 

* {integer|string} __[file.preferredDuplicates="auto"]__ - preferred number of file copies on the network. If indicated in percent, the calculation will be based on the network size. If the option is "auto" it will be calculated as `Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(networkSize))`.

* {number|string} __[file.responseCacheLifetime="7d"]__ - period of file caching after giving it to the client.

* {string[]} __[file.mimeWhitelist=[]]__ - whitelist for filtering a file by mime type.

* {string[]} __[file.mimeBlacklist=[]]__ - blacklist for filtering a file by mime type.

* {string[]} __[file.extWhitelist=[]]__ - whitelist for filtering a file by its extension.

* {string[]} __[file.extBlacklist=[]]__ - blacklist for filtering a file by its extension.

* {object|false} __[file.linkCache]__ - file link caching transport options.

* {integer} __[file.linkCache.limit=50000]__ - maximum cache links.

* {number|string} __[file.linkCache.lifetime="1d"]__ - cache link holding period.

* {number|string} __[task.cleanUpStorageInterval="30s"]__ - storage cleanup task interval.

* {number|string} __[task.cleanUpTempDirInterval="20s"]__ - temporary folder cleanup task interval.

* {number|string} __[task.calculateStorageInfoInterval="3s"]__ - storage information calculaion task interval.
